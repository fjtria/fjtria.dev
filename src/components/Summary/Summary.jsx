                        I'm a software engineer from Southern California. I believe in building software that
                        prioritizes the benefit of its users. My goal is to ensure seamless interactions between
                        users and technology and to develop applications that encourage positive social interactions.

                        Other than coding, I enjoy exploring the intersection of art and technology. I'm
                        constantly seeking inspiration from films, games, and other digital media to fuel my
                        own ideas.
