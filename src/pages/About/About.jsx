                    <p>
                        Heyo! I&apos;m FJ, a software engineer and creative based in California. With a diverse background including
                        software development, project management, and video production, I bring a unique perspective and adaptable
                        skill set to every project I take on.

                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    As I grew up, so did technology. I saw devices get thinner, lighter, faster, and then bigger again. This constant and
                    rapid development encouraged me to learn the <em>how</em> behind the technology I use every day. Now, as a university student
                    studying software engineering, my goal is to answer <em>who</em> we build technology for, <em>what</em> problems we need to solve, 
                    and <em>why</em> technology can help us do better.
                </p>

                <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                    I&apos;m passionate about building technologies that have a positive societal impact. That means ensuring that software both meets the needs and
                    respects the concerns of its users. Part of building user-centered products is making sure interfaces are accessible and responsive. It also
                    requires transparency; as builders we should be open about how our software works and how we protect our users. I ensure that the technology I
                    contribute towards is built with quality and authenticity in mind.
